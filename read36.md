# Redux

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React for building user interfaces.

## What is Redux and why it is used?

Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can't be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers).
