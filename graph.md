# Graph

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.


- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## two types of graph

- Directed graph
- Undirected graph
- Complete Graphs  
- Connected
- Disconnected
- Acyclic Graph
- Cyclic Graphs
- Weighted Graphs
