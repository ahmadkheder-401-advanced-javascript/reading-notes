# React

- React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook

- React is a User Interface (UI) library

- React is a tool for building UI components

## Introducing JSX

is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
JSX produces React “elements” that will be renderred in the DOM

### Why JSX

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

## Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

## Terms

- Rendering: The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

- Template: is a pre-designed webpage, or set of HTML webpages that anyone can use.

- State: React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
