# API Server
An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. API stands for application programming interface.

APIs let your product or service communicate with other products and services without having to know how theyâ€™re implemented. 
## router.param(name, callback)
The parameters of the callback function are: request,response, next,value of name param,name of param
                `next indecatiing the next middleware function`

## Middleware
Middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions. Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins.
### Types of Middleware
Mongoose has 4 types of middleware: document middleware, model middleware, aggregate middleware, and query middleware. Document middleware is supported for the following document functions. In document middleware functions, this refers to the document.
middleware functions:  validate, save, remove, updateOne, deleteOne
## Subdocuments
Subdocuments are documents embedded in other documents. In Mongoose, this means you can nest schemas in other schemas. Mongoose has two distinct notions of subdocuments: arrays of subdocuments and single nested subdocuments.
## What is a Subdocument?
Subdocuments are similar to normal documents. Nested schemas can have middleware, custom validation logic, virtuals, and any other feature top-level schemas can use. The major difference is that subdocuments are not saved individually, they are saved whenever their top-level parent document is saved.
