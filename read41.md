# React Native

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const HelloWorldApp = () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center"
      }}>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
export default HelloWorldApp;

```

`<Text>` is a Core Component that displays some text and `<View>` is like the `<div>` or `<span>`

## Expo 

Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
