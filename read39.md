# Redux Toolkit

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

Redux Toolkit simplify and some how reduce the code.

**configureStore()**: wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults.

**createReducer()**: that lets you supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, rather than writing switch statements.

**createAction():** generates an action creator function for the given action type string.

**Thunk:** Thunk is a redux middleware that allows you to do async functions in redux to fetch data.
